1st VERSION:
	This is convenient to deploy Wifi for Jetson TK1.(Other platform don't test)

2nd VERSION:
	Repair a lot of problems for wifi.sh and it can only install for pci-wifi semi-automatically.
	1. set the variable problem of REBOOT_PARAMETER for wifi.sh .
	2. ">" change "tee" for the commond --> sudo apt-get install xxxx | __________(you choose).
	3. delete line by sed is not good to replace /etc/profile .
	4. find wifi by the commond --> iwlist wlan0 scan that has a problem. you should add "sudo" for it.
	5. at last, you should reboot again for deploy your wifi, because sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart is so bad.
